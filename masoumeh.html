      is set to return this year in a slightly new format. While in-person
      events will be taking place in select locations, Warner Bros. Discovery
      are discouraging fans from traveling to Kings Cross train station in
      London, where previous celebrations have taken place. Taking place on
      Sept. 1 (the day Hogwarts pupils traditionally take the train from London
      to school), the event began as an adhoc gathering of fans each year in
      London and has since morphed into an annual extravaganza now backed by
      WBD. Last year’s event saw thousands of fans, many in costumes and
      carrying wands, descend on Kings Cross, causing issues for passengers
      trying to catch their trains.
