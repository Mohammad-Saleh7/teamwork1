                        </summary>
                            With its elegant white coat, long spiraled horn, and flowing mane, the unicorn embodies purity and grace. These creatures are often found in enchanted forests, where they roam freely, symbolizing innocence and enchantment.
                            <br/>

                            Unicorns possess remarkable abilities; <mark>their blood is said to have healing properties, capable of restoring life to those who consume it.</mark> 
                            <br/>

                            <strong>However, this comes at a great cost,</strong> as drinking unicorn blood curses the drinker with a life devoid of joy. This duality highlights the unicorn's role as both a source of wonder and a reminder of the consequences of tampering with nature.
                            <br/>

                            In addition to their physical beauty, unicorns are known for their intelligence and sensitivity. They are incredibly elusive and can sense danger, making them difficult to approach. In the Harry Potter series, they are depicted as gentle beings that prefer solitude. 
                            <br/>

                            Their presence in the wizarding world serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between magic and morality, as well as the importance of respecting all living creatures. The unicorn remains a symbol of hope and purity, captivating the hearts of those who encounter it.
